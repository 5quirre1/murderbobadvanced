REWRITTEN-   
Murderbob’s mother, Frito, left for her work trip early that morning. Murderbob doesn’t know anything yet, until he finally gets that dreaded phone call.  
“Hello? We have some news for you. Your mother has passed.”  
Murderbob is devastated. His mother is dead now. He cries at home until he hears a knock on his door. It’s the police. They’ve come to interrogate Murderbob on what happened. He gets asked a few questions. They let him go back home. As he sits at home, pondering what to do, There’s another knock at his door. It’s Lovelypants, his friend. He comforts Murderbob during the situation, then leaves. Murderbob decides to hold a funeral for his mom, and as people come, he gets another phone call.  
“It’s the Squirtward gang. Don’t even try to think about hosting that funeral. We’ve got you surrounded. Cancel it, and we won’t do any harm.”  
Murderbob, already being quite terrified, cancels the event and kicks everyone out. He heads back home, and decides to mourn the death of his mom by himself. Someone calls him, and it’s the Squirtward gang again. They tell him “You listened, good. Just remember, fuck around, find out.”  
He decides enough is enough, so he calls the police.  
They tell him that they can’t do much without knowing any info about them. He immediately regrets his decision, as when he walks outside, he hears a loud gunshot sound go off. He sees a Squirtward stare at him from under the porch, as he slowly backs away. He heads to Lovelypants’s house to go talk, but while he’s gone, his house gets raided by the Squirtward gang. They completely destroyed the house. He’s had enough. He finally cracked. He went to go find the Squirtwards and brought a GLOCK with him, and as he walks towards their alleyway, he realizes “I’m fucking ASS at shooting. If I do this i’m so fucked”. He decides to return (fucking failure 😭) and learns from a “professional” (dunno if my isp will let me off with that one 😭😭😭). He starts his first battle, against their lookout team. Murderbob EASILY wins that battle (make it so you actually fight against them, like maybe 5 or something), but he’s faced with a new challenge. They sent their strongest troops, and murderbob escapes battle (fucking baby). After he escapes from the Squirtward gang, he goes to a gas station, named Lit. He finds Lovelypants there. This is when MurderBob starts to feel attracted to Lovelypants.   
“Can I buy you a drink?” MurderBob asks.  
“No, I’m good,” Lovelypants responds.  
Lovelypants and MurderBob talk about things at the table in the station when suddenly he gets a call. No, not MurderBob. Lovelypants.  
“We have your family. We will put them to use.. In the sink. Give up your location or else,” the caller says. Probably one of the Squirtwards, but they aren’t sure.  
MurderBob heard the whole thing.  
“This is ridiculous\! No person should be threatened like this. We need to take action. NOW\!” MurderBob says, slamming his hands on the table.  
The gas station worker heard the commotion\! “Oh no\! I heard what was going on. Can I help you two?”  
“Sure\! What should we do, though? We can’t get the police involved as the Squirtward gang has been killing for YEARS\! There’s no way the police would catch them,” MurderBob responded.  
“Well, we have CCTV across the town. Maybe we can catch them through that?”  
“Hmmm… Where would the-” MurderBob tried to say as he got interrupted by the news.  
“BREAKING NEWS\! SQUIRTWARD GANG IS ROBBING FREAKYCITY BANK\!” the news screamed.  
“Holy skibidi\! Let’s run there now\!” the worker exclaimed.  
“We should take any chance we get.” MurderBob said. (gas station —\> bank —-\> ???)

PLEASE PUT THE FOLLOWING TEXT IN THE GAME LATER, WE WANT IT TO BE LATER  
“Hmmm.. Yeah, it isn’t… What could we do? I heard they had a website up but I don’t know where.. Something like REDACTED\!” the worker said.  
“What the hell are we gonna do with their website?” MurderBob exclaimed  
“Hold on,” says the worker. “If they hold sign-ups, we can *act* like one of them and see what they’re up to\!”  
“Genius\!”  
(they visit the website using a computer running REDACTED)
